This complex script prints an ASCII spaceship in function of a length a user chooses via terminal using the flag '-length'. For example, run in terminal '$luanspaceship -length 10'.
There are also others flags with their functions. Type '$luanspaceship -h' to see what are the flags availables and what they do.
